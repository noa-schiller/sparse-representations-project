# sparse-representations-project
Code for internal and external adaptation methods tesed on the models GroupSC and DnCNN.
Both adaptation methods are presented in the paper ["LIDIA: Lightweight Learned Image Denoising with Instance Adaptation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07167.pdf).
The code for GroupSc is based on and uses the code in [https://github.com/bruno-31/groupsc](https://github.com/bruno-31/groupsc).
The code for DnCNN is based on and uses the code in  [https://github.com/cszn/KAIR](https://github.com/cszn/KAIR).
